# Final-Capstone-Project

## Project/Goals
My wife works in the field of Human Resources and she was fascinated about what I have learned in my Data Analytics Bootcamp.  I consulted with her asking what she would be interested if the numbers could give deep insight in her line of work.  She suggested to me about employee attrition - the departure of employees from an organization, whether voluntary or involuntary.  This is important to Human Resources because it is a metric that provides insight on how well does an organization retain their workforce.  Reasons for attrition are mainly due to:
- Low compensation
- Poor recognition
- Stunted career growth
- High level of stress

Inspired by her intrigue and passion, I have downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about HR Analytics.  In particular to the subject about employee attrition, I wanted to answer:

1. What does the data on job satisfaction suggest?
2. Does the amount of travel play a factor?
3. Are employees still quitting after a salary increase?
4. Is gender an important element?
5. How long do employees stay before they leave?
