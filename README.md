# Final-Capstone-Project

## Project/Goals
My wife works in the field of Human Resources and she was fascinated about what I have learned in my Data Analytics Bootcamp.  I asked her what she would be interested if the numbers could give deep insight in her line of work.  She suggested to me about pay philosophy - the framework that makes decisions on employees with respect to salaries, bonuses, commissions, and other benefits.  This is important to Human Resources because it helps align with the organization's goals and strategies on:
- Employee Recruitment - Is the company attracting top talent?
- Employee Engagement - How does the company get the best efforts out of people?
- Employee Retention - Are their ways to keep people to continue to work at the company?
- Market Competitivness - Is the company paying just as well as its competitors?
- Fair pay and equity - Does the company compensate people fairly?
- Performance-Based Pay - Is the company paying more for high performers?

Inspired by her intrigue and passion, I have downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about HR Analytics.  In particular, I wanted to answer:

1. Are employees with the same job descriptions being compensated the same?
2. What is the average salary between job titles?
3. Is there a gender wage gap between men and women for the same title and responsibilities?
