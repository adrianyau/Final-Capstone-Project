# Final-Capstone-Project

## Project/Goals
My wife works in the field of Human Resources and she was fascinated about what I have learned in my Data Analytics Bootcamp.  I consulted with her and asked what she would be interested if the numbers could give deep insight in her line of work.  She suggested to me about pay philosophy - the framework that makes decisions on employees compensation.  This is important to Human Resources because it helps align with the organization's goals and strategies on:
- Employee Recruitment
- Employee Engagement
- Employee Retention
- Market Competitivness
- Pay Equity
- Performance-Based Pay

Inspired by her intrigue and passion, I have downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about HR Analytics.  In particular, I wanted to answer:

1. Is the pay attractive with respect to the job?
2. Does pay keep employees motivated and productive?
3. Will pay prevent employees from attrition?
4. Is the pay above or below, or the same, in the job market?
5. Is the pay fair for the job responsibilties and is it without discrimination?
6. Does more good work reward more pay?
