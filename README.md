# Final-Capstone-Project

## Project/Goals
My wife works in the field of Human Resources and she was fascinated about what I have learned in my Data Analytics Bootcamp.  I consulted with her asking what she would be interested if the numbers could give deep insight in her line of work.  She suggested to me about employee attrition - the departure of employees from an organization, whether voluntary or involuntary.  This is important to Human Resources because it is a metric that provides insight on how well does an organization retain their workforce.  Reasons for attrition are mainly due to:
- Low Compensation
- Poor Recognition
- Lack of Career Growth
- High Levels of Stress

Inspired by her intrigue and passion, I have downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about HR Analytics.  With respect to the subject about employee attrition, I wanted to answer:

1. What does the data on job satisfaction suggest?
2. Does the amount of travel play a factor?
3. Are employees still quitting after a salary increase?
4. Is gender an important element?
5. How long do employees stay before they leave?

## Process

1. Download 'HR_Analytics.csv' from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshkonapure/hr-analytics-prediction.
2. Import 'HR_Analytics.csv' to Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
3. Based on the dataset, this is an organization that may belong in the field of healthcare or pharmaceuticals.  There is involvement in scientific research and development, as well as sales and marketing of the products being studied and tested.
