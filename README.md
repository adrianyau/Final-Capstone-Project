# Final-Capstone-Project

## Project/Goals
My wife works in the field of Human Resources and she was fascinated about what I have learned in my Data Analytics Bootcamp.  I asked her what she would be interested if the numbers could give deep insight in her line of work.  She suggested to me about pay philosophy - the framework that makes decisions on employees compensation.  This is important to Human Resources because it helps align with the organization's goals and strategies on:
- Employee Recruitment - Is it attracting top talent?
- Employee Engagement - Does it keep employees motivated and productive?
- Employee Retention - Will it keep employees from quitting their jobs?
- Market Competitivness - Is the salary above or below, or the same, in the job market?
- Pay Equity - Is it fair based on the job responsibilites?
- Performance-Based Pay - Does more good work lead to more compensation?

Inspired by her intrigue and passion, I have downloaded a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about HR Analytics.  In particular, I wanted to answer:

1. Are employees with the same job titles and responsibilities being compensated equally?
2. What is the average salary between job positions?
3. Is there a gender wage gap between men and women for the same job title and responsibilities?
